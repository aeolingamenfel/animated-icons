# Overview

Animated icons is a vanilla custom elements implementation of several animated
icons that you can choose to import into your site in order to have these 
animations as a part of your UI.

## Setup

See the [GitHub readme](https://github.com/aeolingamenfel/animated-icons) for 
more information on installing and setting up the icons to be used in your 
project.

## Triggering Animation

Unless otherwise noted, icons do not animate automatically. Instead, you can 
trigger the animation by either adding the `animate` attribute to the icon 
element, **or** by calling the `.animate()` method on a reference to the icon
element.

In addition, you can reset the animation by removing the attribute or calling
the `.reset()` method on a reference to the icon element.
